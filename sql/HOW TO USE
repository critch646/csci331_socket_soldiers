# NOTE: to facilitate easier testing, there is an 'unlock.sh' bash script to unlock ''*.sh' files in each
# directory, please use:
# > chmod 777 unlock.sh
# to allow it to execute, and then use:
# > ./unlock.sh
# to unlock all .sh files needed for testing/mocking the database.

1. creating/destroying a specific table can be done through:

CREATING TABLES:
> ./create/create_usertable.sh  # will create ONLY the Messages table (will need the Users table though)
> ./create/create_msgtable.sh  # will create ONLY the Messages table (will need the Users table though)

DESTROYING TABLES:
> ./destroy/destroy_msgtable.sh  # will drop ONLY the Users table (will need to drop Messages first)
> ./destroy/destroy_usertable.sh  # will drop ONLY the Users table (will need to drop Messages first)

> ./create_projecttables.sh  # will create BOTH Users, and Messages tables (that order)
> ./destroy_projecttables.sh  # will drop BOTH Messages, and Users tables (that order)
